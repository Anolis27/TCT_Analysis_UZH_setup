	abstract = {Precision tracking in high-energy, high-occupancy, particle physics experiments has been previously limited to spatial measurements, such that the trajectory of particles is reconstructed from charge depositions that are recorded in 3 dimensions (x, y, z). However, a new paradigm called 4D tracking, in which the precise time of the charge depositions are also recorded, is becoming possible. Such 4D tracking would enable the reconstruction of charged particles at much higher occupancy, and also provide particle identification since heavier particles move slower than lighter ones for the same momentum. Crucial for establishing 4D tracking in hadron colliders are sensors with close to 100 \% efficiency, tens of micrometers in position resolution, tens of picoseconds in time resolution, radiation hardness that can withstand years of running conditions, as well as accurate and low-power accompanying electronics for digitizing the signals. In this PhD dissertation, several options of a type of sensor known as a low-gain avalanche diode (LGAD) are extensively tested and detailed specifications are reported. Both trench-isolated LGADs (TI-LGADs) and AC-coupled resistive-silicon detector LGADS (AC-RSD-LGADs) are examined and compared as solutions for 4D tracking. Options for digitization of the signals in dedicated electronics are also evaluated. Finally, an evaluation of sensors for a simpler use case of incorporating an endcap timing layer (ETL) in the CMS experiment for the HL-LHC operation is presented. The findings are promising, and options for a future 4D tracking detector that could be incorporated into an upgrade of the CMS experiment or other future experiments are proposed along with their advantages and disadvantages.},
