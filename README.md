# TCT_Analysis_UZH_setup

This repo contains the code for the TCT Analysis of the TCT setup at UZH. This README is a guide to help you to run the analysis.

The software of the TCT setup and the code for the analysis was originally made for Ti-LGAD TCT measurements. The code was then also adapted for the analysis of TCT measurements on CASSIA sensors.

## Ti-LGAD ANALYSIS

Two versions of the python code are available depending on how the analysis was performed. 

### OLD VERSION

This script should run for the analysis for data taken around the interpad region in the same configuration than on the 2D amplitude plot given below.

This is the original verions of the code and has not been tested yet.

### NEW VERSION

This script runs for the analysis for data taken around the whole opening in the same configuration than on the 2D amplitude plot given below.
